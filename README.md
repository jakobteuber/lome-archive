# G+ LoME Archive

[***Archive Page***](https://jakobteuber.github.io/lome-archive)

This is an archive of [Tamas Ferencz](https://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/)'s
Google Plus community “Languages of Middle-Earth” (aka LoME),
that existed from December 2012 until November 2018 when Google Plus was shut down for private customers.
This archive is an extraction of all posts in this group to keep the contributions to Eldarin scholarship
accessible.

The content in this archive has been created by the former members of the G+ group
and it was not possible to read all of them, if you encounter any offensive content,
please message me. Also, for that same reason be careful about opening links that
have been created by the users and always check the link URL before opening them.

It has been impossible to seek out every member of this community to ask them for
permission to republish its contents. However as this has been a scholarly group
discussing Tolkien's languages and should not have contained much “personal” content
I think this is acceptable. If you want your posts removed, please message me

- by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jakobteuber/lome-archive/issues/new/choose),
- via email (see the [Archive Index](https://jakobteuber.github.io/lome-archive)), or
- on the *Vinyë Lambengolmor* Discord server as `@gilruin` (Gilruin).
